# Shopping Basket

## Exercise

You have been asked to model a shopping basket. We must be able to:
- Add items to the shopping basket         
- Remove items from the shopping basket         
- Empty the shopping basket

Additionally, we must be able to calculate the total of the shopping basket 
accounting for:

- Buy one get one free discounts on items         
- 10% off on totals greater than Â£20 (after bogof)         
- 2% off on total (after all other discounts) for customers with loyalty          
  cards

There is no requirement to create a GUI but we must be able to see the code running correctly.

## Installing & Running

The program is written in Python 2.7, it **may** run on other versions.

It's tested this on Windows and Linux, but not Mac.

You can run a demo with:

```sh
$ cd code_clan_shopping_basket
$ python shopping_basket
```

This will run a quick demo printing output to the command line, showing basic functioning.

Here's an [online percentage calculator](http://www.percentagecalculator.co/Add-Subtract-Percentage.html) for quick checking.

## Unit tests

There are 18 unit tests, coverage is not complete, and there is no protection against edge cases or invalid input (not that there is a user interface).

The tests are written with [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/contents.html) which you will need to install if you want to run the tests:

```sh
$ cd code_clan_shopping_basket
$ py.test
```

## Comments on some decisions

Some of the decisions I made and why:

- I decided against using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), as you may not by a Pythony person and it would just cause extra hassle when all you want to do is check my code.
- I used [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/contents.html) because I find it lets me write cleaner test code than Python's default unittest. This is a depencency which might hinder you being able to run the tests, but not the app, so I thought it was a fair trade-off.
- I put the test files in the same directory as the source files. I think that's acceptable on a project this size (plus you can easily see which source files don't have a test counterpart)
- I didn't build any data persistence, or a GUI. I focused instead on creating a discount system that is flexible, testable, reusable and extendable.
- I'm assessing product uniqueness on description (e.g. "apples" vs "oranges") and not on unique id as you would in a real system, purely because it's easier to follow what's going on in the context of a demo.

## Documentation

I put comments and explanations in the source code instead of in here, to avoid you jumping back and forth.

The best place to start is probably **\_\_main\_\_.py**, which runs the demo. The code in is just for you to tweak to see things run, it's not particularly well structured...

Everything else should be reasonably well organised, with mostly one class per file, and a test file named after the source file it tests.
